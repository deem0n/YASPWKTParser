## Goals

There are several WKT parsers on github targeted iOS/OS X. They usually split POLYGON blocks by comma and use regexp for parsing coordinates. While regexps are fast, splitting means that you need two-pass scanning on possibly large text. First pass is for splitting and second pass is for regexping. 

Also, I did not find any parser which reports back parse errors and position in WKT where it failed. So I decided to implement my own WKT parser which is hopefully:

* fast
* error prone
* memory efficient

Instead of two-pass parsing I use NSScanner and C-arrays to store parsed coordinates. It is both fast and memory efficient. For example, this implementation is 4 times faster than [WKTParser](https://github.com/alejandrofcarrera/WKTParser) (As of June 2016).

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
